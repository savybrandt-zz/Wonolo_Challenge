            Studio Moya is a film studio created by writer & director Nathaniel Garofalo and based in Oakland, CA. <br/>
            We aim to produce challenging and bold narrative works with qualities we believe truly set them apart from other contemporary film. <br/>
            <br/>
            In some translations, the Kanji character ÈùÑ (Moya) means Dust, Fog, Mist, Vapor. <br/>
            These words bring with them an overwhelming visual presence, and with those images, a fleeting notion, given their literal meanings. <br/>
            The strongest and most painful memories are much like these words: fleeting and intangible. <br/>
            They surround you with nothing to grasp on to. <br/>
            <br/>
            Studio Moya is in the early stages, you can read more about our first project Gods of the American Landscape in our Projects section.<br/>
             To make this short film, and eventually feature films, we need a core team of creatives and professionals to produce these works. <br/>
